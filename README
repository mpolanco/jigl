Gerrit-Launchpad Jira Plugin

Information:
This plugin adds the following tabs to the view issue screen:
Whiteboard - displays the whiteboard in its current status as it would be displayed on a Launchpad blueprint
Gerrit - displays the comments posted on a Gerrit review for a given commit id

Installation
Note: Specifics on installation still need to be determined
Requires the creation of the following custom fields by the Jira system admin:
- Launchpad Blueprint URL
- Git Commit ID

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
