Gerrit-Launchpad Jira Plugin

Information:
This plugin adds the following tabs to the view issue screen:
Whiteboard - displays the whiteboard in its current status as it would be displayed on a Launchpad blueprint
Gerrit - displays the comments posted on a Gerrit review for a given commit id

Installation
In order for this plugin to fully work, the user must have an Openstack account configured with the user's public ssh key (this is to access comments for the Gerrit review tab as currently the only available means of accessing these is via an SSH API). Additionally, the following Custom Fields must be added to the Jira environment under Issue workflow screens:
- Gerrit ID
- Launchpad Blueprint URL
To have these fields added, please contact your Jira Administrator.
